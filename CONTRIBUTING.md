# Introduction

### Welcome

> First off, thank you for considering contributing to flutter_screen_streaming. It's people like you that make flutter_screen_streaming such a great plugin.

### Why they should read these guidelines.

> Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### What kinds of contributions this project needs.

> flutter_screen_streaming is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community — you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into flutter_screen_streaming itself.

### Explain contributions you are NOT looking for (if any).

> Please, don't use the issue tracker for [support questions]. 

# Ground Rules

> Responsibilities
> * Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every major change that's accepted. Android, iOS, Web, Windows, Mac & Linux.
> * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
> * Don't add any unnecessary classes to the codebase.
> * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
> * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Your First Contribution

> If you'd like to contribute to this project, it's best to check out the issue tracker. There are tasks and issues logged, and you can participate in their development.

### How to contribute small changes and improvements

> Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch.
>
>As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
>* Spelling / grammar fixes
>* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
>* Comment clean up
>* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
>* Adding logging messages or debugging output
>* Changes to ‘metadata’ files .gitignore, etc.
>* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# How to report a bug

> If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Please contact the developer using other forms of communication.
>
> In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
> * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
> * Can I disable something for other people?
>
> If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just contact the developer.

### How to file a bug report

> When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
>
> 1. What version of Flutter and Dart are you using (flutter doctor)?
> 2. What operating system and testing device are you using?
> 3. What did you do?
> 4. What did you expect to see?
> 5. What did you see instead?

### Desired process for suggesting a feature

> If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in flutter_screen_streaming, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process

> The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis.
> After feedback has been given we expect responses from the contributer.

# Code, commit message and labeling conventions

> Please use English only.
> Please comment your code in an understandable way so that a good teamwork is possible.
> Please choose understandable names for variables, classes and functions, even if they might be a bit longer.
